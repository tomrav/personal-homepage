        <p>
            Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth is an aged, eccentric, yet accomplished inventor, founder and owner of Planet
            Express and an honorary Globetrotter. He is crotchety, absent-minded and sometimes brilliant, most
            well-known for his work in 30th century robotics. In 2999, he was the last known relative of Philip J. Fry.
            Later, Professor Farnsworth discovered that he had fathered a son, as well as the clone that he had kept
            hidden. In addition, he also serves as a tenured professor at Mars University teaching the Mathematics of
            Quantum Neutrino Fields. Farnsworth is an inventor of both useful and impractical things, some of which are
            extremely dangerous, such as his Doomsday devices.
            Personality-wise, he varies from callous disregard to sentimental affection. He has no objection to sending
            his crew on missions which may eventually kill them, and has sent previous crews to their deaths before. (At
            times, he even seems eager to send crews on life-threatening missions.) Farnsworth is the oldest living
            member of the Academy of Inventors, where he often competes with his arch nemesis, Dr. Ogden Wernstrom.
