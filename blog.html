        <h2>Invention Spotlight: Killbots</h2>

    <p>
        Killbots are Robots designed especially for killing, often as either in war (1ACV04), for assassinational needs
        (6ACV06), or property guarding (BG). They are not a specific kind of Robots per se, and there are multiple types
        by several different inventors, including Professor Farnsworth, Dr. Wernstrom, and Mom. Killbots are owned and
        used by both Humans and other Robots.
    </p>

    <h3>Technological details</h3>

    <p>
        Seeing as there are many types of killbots, the technological details vary, but all known types have some sort
        of weapon, for example gun, cannon, scythe or hammer, attached to their forearms. It is unknown if it is a
        equipment upgrade or a feature on a certain model, but they have seen shown to have a minigun in their chest,
        which fires continously and has caused them to destroy each other if they speak to each other.
    </p>

    <h3>Octillion</h3>

    <p>
        For unknown reasons, a kill limit of 999,999 is hardcoded into killbots. Zapp Brannigan once faced a horde of
        these killing machines, and defeated them by sacrificing millions of his own men, until the killbots' kill limit
        was reached. When the kill-limit is reached, killbots become peaceful and in fact rather friendly. However,
        their kill counter has the option of being reset, which reactivates their ability and desire to kill.

    <h2>Quote of the Day</h2>
    <blockquote>
        [About altering the timeline.] And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you
        were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

        <h2>Origin: Catchphrase</h2>
        <time datetime="3003-04-22">22 Apr 3003</time>
    </header>
    <blockquote>
        <h3>
            Good news, everyone!
        </h3>
        <cite>-Professor Farnsworth.</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Originally, the professor's catchphrase was going to be "...though I am already in my pajamas." This was only
        used in the first and second episodes.
    </p>

    <p>
        The professor's basic catchphrase is "Good news, everyone!" The phrase is used so frequently that it was already
        possible to joke about it in the seventh episode.
    </p>

    <p>
        He also occasionally refers to "Zombie Jesus" either by saying "Sweet Zombie Jesus" or "Holy Zombie Jesus".
    </p>

    <p>
        When he is spoken to or asked a question, he also commonly says "Eh-wha?" This is used often to emphasize his
        senility and hearing loss.
    </p>

    <p>
        Occasionally, he will say something along the lines of "What in ________ happened?!" For instance, "What in Sega
        Genesis happened to you?!" or "What in Satan's glorious name is going on here?!"
    </p>

    <p>
        Another "catchphrase" used by the Professor is "Oh My..."
    </p>

    <p>
        Farnsworth also likes to use the phrase "Fuff" as a way of saying "Forget it" or "It was nothing" or "Baloney".
    </p>

    <p>
        Furthermore, he likes to dismiss other people's opinions by saying "Quiet, you!", often to people who have just
        actually contributed something useful to a discussion.
    </p>

    <p>
        The last catchphrase used by the Professor is "Wernstrom!"
