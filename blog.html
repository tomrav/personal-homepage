			Killbots are Robots designed especially for killing, often as either in war (1ACV04), for assassinational needs (6ACV06), or property guarding (BG). They are not a specific kind of Robots per se, and there are multiple types by several different inventors, including Professor Farnsworth, Dr. Wernstrom, and Mom. Killbots are owned and used by both Humans and other Robots.

		<h3>Technological details</h3>
		<p>
			Seeing as there are many types of killbots, the technological details vary, but all known types have some sort of weapon, for example gun, cannon, scythe or hammer, attached to their forearms. It is unknown if it is a equipment upgrade or a feature on a certain model, but they have seen shown to have a minigun in their chest, which fires continously and has caused them to destroy each other if they speak to each other.
		</p>
		<h3>Octillion</h3>
		<p>
			For unknown reasons, a kill limit of 999,999 is hardcoded into killbots. Zapp Brannigan once faced a horde of these killing machines, and defeated them by sacrificing millions of his own men, until the killbots' kill limit was reached. When the kill-limit is reached, killbots become peaceful and in fact rather friendly. However, their kill counter has the option of being reset, which reactivates their ability and desire to kill.
