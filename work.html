        <h2>Creations</h2>

        <p>
            The professor, being a vivid inventor, has created numerous inventions, ranging from very sophisticated to
            down right crazy.
            Here is a list of the Professor's inventions (in alphabetical order)
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>What if machine</dt>
            <dd>
                The What-If Machine is a machine made out of gold that displays scenarios. These scenarios are given in
                the form of "what if" questions. The questions only have to make sense in context. At the end of "Twice
                Told Tales of Interest", the What-If machine (being used as a poker buddy by Bender) self destructed,
                because of a self-destruct chip Bender used when turning it into a robot thinking it was an Empathy
                Chip. However, Professor Farnsworth implied that the machine would be fixed in a year. Every time
                Farnsworth activates the machine, he uses a different button, lever, knob, or switch.
                <img src="http://theinfosphere.org/images/9/98/What_if_Machine.jpg" alt="What if machine">
            </dd>
            <dt>Smell-O-Scope</dt>
            <dd>
                The Smell-O-Scope allows the user to smell odours over astronomically long distances ("If a dog craps
                anywhere in the universe, you can bet I won't be out of the loop"). It was created by Professor
                Farnsworth in 2999 and won the Academy of Inventors Academy Prize in 3000 after the prize had been taken
                away from Dr. Ogden Wernstrom as it became apparent that he was a jackass.
                The degree of odour can be measured on a meter called the "Funkometer". It is unknown how the device
                functions, but it apparently has a lens and a stench coil.
                As Cubert points out, it is impossible for odour molecules to travel through the vacuum of space and
                reach the user's nose. However, it is possible that the Smell-O-Scope actually analyzes various
                spectrums, determines the chemical makeup, and reproduces the smell within its nostril-tubes, much like
                a television reproduces sounds and images.
                It is possible for the Smell-O-Scope to be mounted to the ship in order to track a smell to its origin.
                [2ACV10] It also caused the death of Nudar's time-paradox duplicate by crushing him after Farnsworth
                leant on it.

            </dd>
            <dt>Device that makes anyone sound like Farnsworth</dt>
            <dd>
                The device that makes anyone sound like Farnsworth was created by Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth
                himself. It's a brown-coloured machine which changes one's voice to sound like his. Cubert and Dwight
                used it to trick the Planet Express crew into going on a fake delivery to a planet that doesn't exist
                (3ACV12). There's no target market for this device, only potential consumer, which Farnsworth describes
                as targets that will tremble in fear as their new masters hand down edicts in his glorious, booming
                voice.
